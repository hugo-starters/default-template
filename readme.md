# Linting
npm run lint will run eslint, stylelint and prettier

You should install code editor plugins for eslint, stylelint and prettier, so that you can see errors in real time, and format on save.

# Editor config settings
If using VS Code, you need the editorconfig plugin to inherit the .editorconfig settings.

# Installation

You need to have node.js installed, and run npm install after cloning the git repository
